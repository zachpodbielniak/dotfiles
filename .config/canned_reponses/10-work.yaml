    Thank you for your partnership and patience on this issue. To continue my investigation, I need <the info that was requested>. However I understand that priorities can change, so out of respect for your time I'll mark this ticket as “solved” if I don't hear back from you by the end of the day. No information will be lost, and you can re-open this ticket within 7 days when you're able to work on it. Beyond that time, you can always create a new follow-up ticket which will link back to the original. Please be assured that we're here to help and are always happy to hear from you. If you're ready to continue now, that's great and I'll look for your update.
