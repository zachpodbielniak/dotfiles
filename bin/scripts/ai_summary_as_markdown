# AI Summary as Markdown
# ======================
# This script generates structured markdown summaries from any text input using AI.
# It provides specialized prompt templates for different content types and leverages
# either perpy, claudpy, or grokpy for AI processing, with support for model selection.

   - Social media sharing buttons and links
   - Advertisement placeholders or promotional content

   - Keep the natural flow and readability of the article
   - Do not add any summary or interpretation - just clean extraction
   - Do not add any prefatory text like "Here is the cleaned content" - start directly with the content

The goal is to extract what a reader would see if they used "Reader Mode" in a web browser - just the core article content without any website chrome or navigation elements.
