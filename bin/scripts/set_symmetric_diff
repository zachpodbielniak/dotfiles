set_symmetric_diff - Lines in either input but NOT in both

USAGE:
	set_symmetric_diff [OPTIONS] FILE1 FILE2
	set_symmetric_diff [OPTIONS] - FILE2  (read first input from stdin)

OPTIONS:
	-h, --help      Show this help message
	--license       Show license information
	-i, --ignore-case Case-insensitive comparison

EXAMPLES:
	set_symmetric_diff file1.txt file2.txt
	cat file1.txt | set_symmetric_diff - file2.txt

DESCRIPTION:
	Output lines that appear in either input but NOT in both.
	This is like an XOR operation on sets.
